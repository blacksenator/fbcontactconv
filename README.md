# Converter of FRITZ!Box contacts into IP phone phonebooks

Purpose of the software is the converting of contact data from AVM FRITZ!Box phonebook (XML) into XML phonebook formats of various IP phone devices.

This is aspin-off from [carddav2fb](https://github.com/blacksenator/carddav2fb)! You will also find this functionality there as the final part of a comprehensive program for loading CardDAV data (vCards) into the FRITZ!Box as phonebook.

## Features

* The conversion takes place with **XSL transformation**. The XML of the FRITZ! Box is converted into the XML target format on the basis of the respective XSL file
* If necessary or possible, the name chain is divided into first name and surname. The prerequisite is the assumption that a comma with a space separates `[first name], [last name]`. If no ", " is found in the string, the name chain is used as the organization or surname (depending on the target format)
* specify an entry in `ipPhonebooks` if the phone book is to be stored in your desired format (XML). There are currently five transformation templates stored in the `/lib/` directory:
* Cisco
* Grandstream
* jFritz (not a phone but similar XML structure)
* snom
* Yealink

## Requirements

* PHP >7.3 or 8.0 (incl. gd, soap, xsl)
* Composer (follow the installation guide at <https://getcomposer.org/download/>)
